The lostbutfound project is a WEB app that will help its users to find lost items and also post lost items.

Here a user will be allowed to find a lost item without nessarily having to log into the app as an app user.
But for sure will not be ae to post an item,if he doesn't has an account in the app.
Hence a user who has an account in the app will be able to post and find lost items
While a user that wouldn't have a user account will only be able to find for a lost item,only.
